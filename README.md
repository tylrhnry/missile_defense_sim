![Missile Simulation](./missile_paths.gif)

This program simulates the flight of two missiles. One "enemy" missile, that has a pre-defined target, and one "interceptor" missile, that targets the enemy missile. The enemy missile was given a non-linear flight path to make targeting more difficult. I plan on adding spline regression to the interceptor's targeting calcualtion to make the path prediction more sophisticated. 

This program was written to teach my co-workers some of the basics of the Rust programming language. As such, some of the design choices are non-optimal and were used purely as a way to demonstrate a variety of Rust's features. Additionally, much of the comments were for my own reference as I went through the process of iteratively programming this with a group.
